**Effective Date:** [DATE]
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** [DATE]

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the WeKruit Valet service ("Service"), including our website, API, browser extension, and any related applications, you ("User," "you") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Service.

WeKruit, Inc. ("WeKruit," "we," "us," "our") reserves the right to update these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes by email and by posting a notice on the Service. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you are using Autopilot Mode, material changes to these Terms will require your re-consent before Autopilot can be reactivated.

## 2. Description of Service

WeKruit Valet is a dual-mode AI-assisted job application tool:

- **Copilot Mode** (default): The Service uses artificial intelligence to analyze job postings, fill application forms, and generate responses to screening questions. In Copilot Mode, you review every field and explicitly approve every application before submission.

- **Autopilot Mode** (optional, earned): After meeting eligibility requirements, you may activate Autopilot Mode, which allows the Service to submit applications on your behalf within parameters you define, without per-application review. Autopilot Mode is subject to additional terms in Section 10.

The Service operates using anti-detect browser technology, residential proxies, and large language models (LLMs) to automate the job application process on third-party platforms including, but not limited to, LinkedIn, Greenhouse, Lever, and Workday.

## 3. Eligibility

You must be at least 16 years of age to use the Service in Copilot Mode. You must be at least 18 years of age and have the legal capacity to authorize an electronic agent to act on your behalf to use Autopilot Mode. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet the applicable age requirements.

## 4. Account Registration and Security

4.1. You must register for an account using a valid Google account via OAuth 2.0 authentication. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials.

4.2. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and to update such information as necessary.

4.3. You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

4.4. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that we reasonably believe are being used fraudulently or in violation of these Terms.

## 5. Acceptable Use

5.1. You agree to use the Service only for legitimate job-seeking purposes. You must not use the Service to:

  - Submit applications to positions for which you are clearly unqualified with the intent to waste employer resources.
  - Submit false, misleading, or fraudulent information in any application.
  - Interfere with or disrupt third-party platforms, their infrastructure, or other users' experiences.
  - Circumvent technical measures implemented by third-party platforms designed to prevent automated access, including but not limited to CAPTCHAs, rate limits, and bot detection systems, except as facilitated by normal use of the Service.
  - Use the Service in any manner that violates applicable law or regulation.
  - Resell, sublicense, or provide access to the Service to third parties.

5.2. You acknowledge that the Service is designed for individual use. Each account must correspond to a single natural person who is the actual job applicant.

## 6. Third-Party Platform Risks

6.1. The Service interacts with third-party job platforms ("Platforms") that are not owned, controlled, or operated by WeKruit. These Platforms have their own Terms of Service, which may prohibit or restrict automated tools.

6.2. **You acknowledge and agree that:**

  (a) Using the Service may violate the Terms of Service of one or more Platforms.

  (b) Platforms may take action against your account, including warnings, temporary restrictions, permanent suspensions, or bans, in response to automated activity.

  (c) WeKruit has no control over Platform enforcement decisions and cannot guarantee the continued availability of your accounts on any Platform.

  (d) WeKruit is not responsible for any consequences arising from Platform enforcement actions, including but not limited to loss of account access, loss of connections or data, reputational harm, or missed job opportunities.

6.3. WeKruit implements conservative rate limiting, human-like timing patterns, and anti-detection measures to minimize the risk of Platform enforcement. However, these measures cannot eliminate the risk entirely.

6.4. If any Platform sends a cease-and-desist or similar demand to WeKruit, we may be required to disable Service functionality for that Platform immediately, with or without notice.

## 7. Data Processing and Privacy

7.1. Your use of the Service is also governed by our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy), which is incorporated by reference into these Terms.

7.2. To provide the Service, we process the following categories of data:

  - Resume and profile information you upload or provide.
  - Job posting content from Platforms you target.
  - Form responses generated by AI and approved by you (Copilot) or submitted by the Service (Autopilot).
  - Screenshots of application submissions for your audit trail.
  - Usage metadata including timestamps, Platform identifiers, and performance metrics.

7.3. Your data is processed by AI sub-processors (Anthropic, OpenAI) via their enterprise API services. Your data is not used for AI model training. See our Privacy Policy for complete sub-processor disclosures.

## 8. Intellectual Property

8.1. The Service, including all software, algorithms, interfaces, documentation, and branding, is the intellectual property of WeKruit and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

8.2. Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service for your personal, non-commercial job-seeking purposes.

8.3. You retain all rights to the content you provide to the Service, including your resume, profile data, and Q&A bank responses. You grant us a limited license to process this content solely for the purpose of providing the Service.

## 9. Copilot Mode Terms

9.1. In Copilot Mode, you initiate each application by providing a specific job URL. The Service analyzes the job posting, fills application forms using your profile data and AI-generated responses, and presents the completed form for your review.

9.2. **You are responsible for reviewing all fields before approving submission.** The Service provides confidence scores and source indicators for each field to assist your review, but the final decision to submit rests with you.

9.3. By approving a submission in Copilot Mode, you represent that you have reviewed the application and that the information is accurate to the best of your knowledge.

## 10. Autopilot Mode Terms

10.1. **Definition and Scope.** Autopilot Mode enables the Service to automatically submit job applications on your behalf without requiring your review or approval of each individual application prior to submission. Autopilot operates within the parameters you define during the Autopilot consent process, including target platforms, job criteria, maximum applications per session, salary range, and company exclusion lists ("Autopilot Parameters").

10.2. **Electronic Agent Authorization.** By activating Autopilot Mode, you acknowledge and agree that:

  (a) The Service will function as an "electronic agent" as defined under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) and the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN), acting on your behalf within the defined Autopilot Parameters.

  (b) Under UETA Section 14, job applications submitted by the Service in Autopilot Mode are legally attributable to you as if you had submitted each application manually.

  (c) You are responsible for defining accurate and appropriate Autopilot Parameters before each session. The Service will operate within these parameters but cannot guarantee that every application will perfectly match your intent.

  (d) Job applications, once submitted, are generally irrevocable. While the Service provides tools to attempt application withdrawal where technically feasible, we cannot guarantee the success of any withdrawal request.

10.3. **Quality Assurance and Error Prevention.** In accordance with UETA Section 10(b), the Service provides error-prevention mechanisms including:

  (a) Confidence scoring for all AI-generated form responses with a mandatory minimum threshold of 80%.

  (b) Hard blocks on sensitive fields including Social Security Numbers, legal consent forms, background check authorizations, and Equal Employment Opportunity demographic questions (unless you have explicitly configured responses).

  (c) Post-submission review summaries delivered within 24 hours of each session.

  (d) Nine mandatory quality gates that must all pass before any application is submitted.

10.4. **Your Obligations.** You agree to:

  (a) Review post-submission summaries within 48 hours and promptly flag any applications that contain errors.

  (b) Maintain accurate and up-to-date profile information, Q&A bank responses, and Autopilot Parameters.

  (c) Configure your company exclusion list before activating Autopilot.

  (d) Start with conservative session limits and increase only after reviewing initial results.

10.5. **Revocation.** You may revoke Autopilot authorization at any time using the kill switch (under 2 seconds), account settings, or by contacting support. We reserve the right to disable Autopilot for any user if we determine it poses a risk to you, other users, or WeKruit.

10.6. **Non-Waivable Rights.** Certain protections under UETA Section 10(b) regarding error correction in automated transactions cannot be waived by agreement. Nothing in these Terms is intended to waive such non-waivable rights.

## 11. Fees and Billing

**This one email unlocks Anthropic ($100K), OpenAI ($2.5K), GitHub, and Google Cloud partnerships.**

```
Subject: Quick ask — startup credit program referrals

Hi [Alliance DAO contact name],

Hope you're doing well! Quick question — we're applying for startup credit
programs from our tech stack providers and several of them offer credits
through VC partner referrals.

Could you let me know if Alliance is a partner with any of these programs?
If so, I'd really appreciate any referral codes or application links:

1. Anthropic — VC partner program (up to $100K in Claude API credits)
2. OpenAI — Startup referral program (~$2,500 in API credits)
3. GitHub — Startup partner program (20 Enterprise seats free)
4. Google Cloud — For Startups referral

Also, could you confirm that WeKruit is listed (or will be listed) on the
Alliance portfolio page at alliance.xyz/companies? We need a public proof
of funding link for several applications.

Thanks so much!
Adam
```

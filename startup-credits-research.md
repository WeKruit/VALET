## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Google Cloud for Startups (High Priority)

Google's program is by far the most generous and directly relevant since you're using Google OAuth already.

**Three tiers:**

- **Start Tier** (pre-funding): $2,000 credits for 12 months + $200 training credits. No VC backing required.
- **Scale Tier** (VC-backed): Up to $200,000 over 2 years. Year 1 covers up to $100K usage; Year 2 gives 20% discount up to $100K.
- **AI Tier** (AI-first startups): Up to $350,000 over 2 years. Year 1 up to $250K; Year 2 20% discount up to $100K. Also includes $10K for partner LLMs (Anthropic Claude, etc.) via Model Garden.

**Bonus perks:** 12 months free Google Workspace Business Plus, $600/month Google Maps credits, Startup Success Manager, co-marketing opportunities.

**Eligibility:** Pre-seed to Series A (if Series A, must be raised within last 12 months). Cannot be IPO'd, acquired, nonprofit, etc.

**Apply:** [cloud.google.com/startup](https://cloud.google.com/startup) or [startup.google.com/cloud](https://startup.google.com/cloud/)

---

### 2. Anthropic Startup Program (High Priority)

Directly relevant since you use Anthropic's Claude API in your LLM package.

**Credits:** Up to $100,000 in Claude API credits, plus priority rate limits and technical resources.

**Anthology Fund (Menlo Ventures):** $25,000 in Claude credits + potential Pre-Seed/Seed/Series A investment from a $100M fund.

**Also accessible through:** Google for Startups AI Tier (additional Anthropic credits through Model Garden).

**Key advantage:** Unlike OpenAI, Anthropic's top credit tiers don't require VC backing -- good for bootstrapped founders.

**Apply:** [claude.com/programs/startups](https://claude.com/programs/startups)

---

### 3. GitHub for Startups (High Priority)

You're already on GitHub. This is essentially free money.

**Benefits:**

- 20 seats of GitHub Enterprise free for 12 months
- Year 2: 50% off
- Optional: 20 seats GitHub Advanced Security at 50% off (Year 1), 25% off (Year 2)

**Eligibility:** Must be new to GitHub Enterprise or haven't been on it in the past 6 months.

**Note:** Metered add-ons (Copilot, larger runners, Codespaces) are NOT included and billed at standard rates.

**Apply:** [github.com/enterprise/startups](https://github.com/enterprise/startups)

---

### 4. OpenAI for Startups (Medium Priority)

Relevant since your LLM package also supports OpenAI.

**Standard:** ~$2,500 in API credits via VC referral.

**OpenAI Grove:** $50K in credits + mentorship, but very competitive (15 participants per cohort). Cohort 2 applications are currently closed.

**How to get credits:** Best path is through a VC partner referral. They'll ask for your org ID and a description of what you're building.

**Apply:** [openai.com/startups](https://openai.com/startups/)

---

### 5. Supabase for Startups (Medium Priority)

You're using Supabase for both database and storage, so this is worth pursuing.

**Options:**

- Direct program: Apply at [supabase.com/solutions/startups](https://supabase.com/solutions/startups)
- Via AWS Activate: $300 in Supabase credits over 12 months
- Via JoinSecret: Reportedly up to $2,000 credits for 1 year (if never raised funds) or $350,000 for 2 years (if funded)

**Apply:** [supabase.com/solutions/startups](https://supabase.com/solutions/startups)

---

### 6. Fly.io (No Program Currently)

Fly.io does **not** have a formal startup credit program. Community members have asked about this multiple times with no official response.

**Options:** Reach out to their team directly for a potential custom arrangement. They do have a free trial with limited credits for testing.

---

### 7. Upstash (No Formal Program Found)

No dedicated startup program found. However, Upstash's pay-as-you-go pricing is already very startup-friendly, and the free tier (256MB data, 500K commands/month) may be sufficient for early-stage usage.

---

### 8. Hatchet (No Formal Program Found)

No startup credit program found. Hatchet is open source (MIT license), YC W24-backed, and can be self-hosted for free. Their cloud offering pricing should be checked directly at [hatchet.run](https://hatchet.run).

## Recommended Action Plan

1. **Apply now (quick wins):**
   - GitHub for Startups -- straightforward, immediate value
   - Anthropic Startup Program -- directly supports your core product
   - Supabase for Startups -- you're already a paying customer

2. **Apply soon (bigger payoff, more effort):**
   - Google Cloud for Startups -- even the Start tier ($2K) is easy to get; AI Tier ($350K) if you have VC backing
   - OpenAI for Startups -- get your VC to provide a referral code

3. **Keep an eye on:**
